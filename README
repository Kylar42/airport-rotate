This requires you to do some prep.

1) You'll need to add a crontab job that calls the osascript.
2) You'll need to add cron and osascript to the Accessibility permissions in the Security System Preference.
3) You need to edit the applescript to point to the directory where you saved the files.
4) you need to chmod +x the randomwords file.

I should clean all this up soon.
